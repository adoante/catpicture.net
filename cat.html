	<h1>Lizzy Gante</h1>
	<p>She's adorable! Born some time around March 2016, she was the runt of her litter. Her mother was a
		Russian blue, and her father was an orange tabby. She is labeled as a grey tabby but has light
		orange patches of fur too! The most prominent of which is the orange spot on her forhead! She was
		bottle-fed from birth because her sibling wouldn't budge. When she was old enough to leave the pack,
		her previous owner sold her to my sister for only $15! What a deal! I was charged with carrying her
		as we brought her home. She was so small that she could fit in the palm of my hand. Tiny! There are
		plenty of photos to see!
